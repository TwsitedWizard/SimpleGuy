    As an expert programmer, analyze the following code changes from 'git diff --staged' and generate a concise and informative commit message.

    **Guidelines:**
    1.  Follow the **Conventional Commits specification**.
    2.  The format MUST be: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
    3.  `<type>` must be one of: **feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore**.
    4.  The `<description>` should be a short summary (max 50 chars) in the imperative mood (e.g., 'Add feature' not 'Added feature').
    5.  Do NOT include a message body or any extra text, just the single commit headline.

    **Code Diff:**
    ```diff
    {diff}
    ```

    **Commit Message:**
